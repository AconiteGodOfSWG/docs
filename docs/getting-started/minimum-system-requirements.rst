Minimum System Requirements
======================================

The SWG Source Server requires a **minimum** of the following resources.

This reflects the amount of resources the *server* needs, which means if you are using the Quick Start Server/Virtual Machine on your normal desktop, you will need *more than* the below requirements (ideally *double*).

**Minimum Recommended System Resources for single or small group players (1-8) with only a few zones/planets running**
* RAM: 8 GB
* CPU: 3 Core
* Hard Disk: 50 GB

**Minimum Recommended System Resources for small to medium group of players (16 to 24) and/or several zones/planets running**
* RAM: 16 GB
* CPU: 4 Core
* Hard Disk: 75 GB

*As a reminder, you should limit the number of planets/zones you run at a time to save system resources and increase performance. It is not necessary to run every planet and zone unless you are running a live server environment.*
