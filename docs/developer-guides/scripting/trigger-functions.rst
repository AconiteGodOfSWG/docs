Trigger Functions
======================================

Script functions are used in the SWG Code Base as a trigger to send information from the `src` (engine) to the `dsrc` (scripts) when specific actions occur. All script functions are defined in [ScriptFunctionTable.cpp](https://github.com/SWG-Source/src/blob/master/engine/server/library/serverScript/src/shared/ScriptFunctionTable.cpp). We won't cover every script function here (there's more than 300) as some were developed for a singular use-case, however, most commonly used functions are explained to get you started.
